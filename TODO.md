- [ ] Create AviSynth runner that will actually pull a single frame out of the
      AviSynth pipeline and be able to check that against a known good source
      for the test harness
- [ ] With above runner, test multi-threading (needed for VirtualDub "play"
      button and it's a fairly safe guess something else)
- [ ] Fix up the template creation into something that isn't freaking speghetti
- [ ] Make the templates created come even remotely close to matching the class
      structure that [docs/api/jsvsynth_api.js] pretends exists.
- [ ] Add all the FIXME instances to this list
- [ ] HTML5-style canvas API (hopefully using libcairo)
