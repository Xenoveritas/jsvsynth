JSVSynth User Documentation
===========================

This documentation describes using JSVSynth from within AviSynth.

Before you can use the plugin, you'll need to load it. This is a "regular"
AviSynth plugin (not a C plugin), so you use:

```avisynth
LoadPlugin("jsvsynth.dll")
```

Once you've loaded the plugin, you have access to the following new
AviSynth functions:

* `JavaScript(code)`
* `ImportJS(filename)`

These allow you to execute JavaScript code from within AviSynth.

`JavaScript(code)` simply executes the JavaScript code given in `code` while
`ImportJS(filename)` loads the file given by `filename` and executes the
contents as JavaScript.

The JavaScript environment within JSVSynth is very similar to what you'd
expect: things like `Number`, `Date`, and `Math` are all there. However, this
isn't a browser: `window` does not exist and most HTML APIs won't be there. (So
no `XMLHttpRequest` or stuff like that.)

Instead, you have the `AviSynth` and `avs` objects, which provides your bridge
between JavaScript and AviSynth. You can access any AviSynth function or
variable from the `avs` object, just like you would any other object:

```javascript
var baz = avs.foo + avs['bar']
```

AviSynth functions can also be accessed that way. Note that all AviSynth
filters are "functions." If you really wanted to, you can even access the
JavaScript plugin through `avs`, although I wouldn't recommend it. (After all,
`eval` is available.)

JSVSynth API
------------

The following are available in the JavaScript environment:

* [`AviSynth.Filter`](javascript_filter.md) - write a filter using JavaScript
* [`AviSynth.VideoFrame`](javascript_videoframe.md) - how to access a video
  frame's data
