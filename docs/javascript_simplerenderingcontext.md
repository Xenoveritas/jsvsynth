SimpleRenderingContext
======================

A `SimpleRenderingContext` is an API that provides you with "basic" access to
the frame. It allows basic things like filling rectanges and copying frames
from another clip into its frame.

The documentation here is somewhat out of date. Check out the JSDoc page on
[AviSynth.SimpleRenderingContext](api/AviSynth.SimpleRenderingContext.html)
instead.
