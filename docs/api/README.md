This documentation describes the JSVSynth API. These objects and functions always exist in the global namespace available to JavaScript code within an AviSynth script.

The {@linkcode avs} object provides access to AviSynth variables and functions. The {@linkcode AviSynth} namespace provides access to the majority of the JSVSynth API and allows more advanced features, like direct access to frame image data and creating AviSynth filters directly in JavaScript.
