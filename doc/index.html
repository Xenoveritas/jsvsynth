<h1>JSVSynth User Documentation</h1>

<p>This documentation describes using JSVSynth from within AviSynth.</p>

<p>Before you can use the plugin, you'll need to load it. This is a "regular"
AviSynth plugin (not a C plugin), so you use:</p>

<pre class="code code-avisynth">LoadPlugin("jsvsynth.dll")</pre>

<p>Once you've loaded the plugin, you have access to the following new
AviSynth functions:</p>

<ul>
<li><code class="code code-avisynth">JavaScript(code)</code></li>
<li><code class="code code-avisynth">ImportJS(filename)</code></li>
</ul>

<p>These allow you to execute JavaScript code from within AviSynth.</p>

<p><code class="code code-avisynth">JavaScript(code)</code> simply executes the
JavaScript code given in <code class="code code-avisynth">code</code> while
<code class="code code-avisynth">ImportJS(filename)</code> loads the file given
by <code class="code code-avisynth">filename</code> and executes the contents as
JavaScript.</p>

<p>The JavaScript environment within AviSynth is very similar to what you'd
expect: things like <code class="code code-javascript">Number</code>,
<code class="code code-javascript">Date</code>, and
<code class="code code-javascript">Math</code> are all there. However, this
isn't a browser: <code class="code code-javascript">window</code> does not exist
and most HTML APIs won't be there. (So no
<code class="code code-javascript">XMLHttpRequest</code> or stuff like that.)</p>

<p>Instead, you have the <code class="code code-javascript">avisynth</code>
object, which provides your bridge between JavaScript and AviSynth. You can
access any AviSynth function or variable from the
<code class="code code-javascript">avs</code> object, just like you would
any other object:</p>

<pre class="code code-javascript">var baz = avs.foo + avs['bar']</pre>

<p>AviSynth functions can also be accessed that way. Note that all AviSynth
filters are "functions." If you really wanted to, you can even access the
JavaScript plugin through <code class="code code-javascript">avs</code>,
although I wouldn't recommend it. (After all,
<code class="code code-javascript">eval</code> remains.)</p>
